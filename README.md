# Disclaimer

## Usage and Purpose:

This repository provides a list of domains for use with Pi-Hole software for content filtering. It is important to note the following:

1. **Diverse Content:**
   - Not all domains in this list are of explicit or adult nature. The list may include a variety of domains serving different content.

2. **False Positives and Negatives:**
   - This list may have false positives, mistakenly blocking non-explicit content, or false negatives, allowing explicit content. Users should be aware of the potential for inaccuracies.

3. **Non-Representative of Companies:**
   - Inclusion in this list does not imply that the companies or entities owning these domains are associated with explicit or inappropriate content. It is not a representation of their reputation.

4. **Disabling Pi-Hole or Removal Requests:**
   - Users who encounter issues, false positives, or wish to access specific sites can disable Pi-Hole temporarily. Alternatively, they can submit a request to have a site removed in case of a false positive.

5. **Limited Liability:**
   - The maintainer of this repository is not liable for any consequences arising from the use of this list. Users are encouraged to review and understand the implications before implementing it.

## Legal Considerations:

This repository is shared in the spirit of community and open-source collaboration. Users are advised to be aware of and comply with the terms of service of the services they interact with, including but not limited to Pi-Hole, GitHub, and the relevant content providers.

# Credits and Notes

A significant portion of the domain list in this repository was sourced from [Bon-Appetit/porn-domains](https://github.com/Bon-Appetit/porn-domains). We extend our gratitude to the contributors of that repository for their efforts.

We combined their list with several others, as well as adding a significant number of domains myself. We will note that it is possible that their list is better maintained than my own and pretty much sticks to just adult content where we have expanded to adult "dating" and "stores".


# Readme is a work in progress. 

Will publish a full readme once we get the project working at some kind of scale. Ideally, we get a few web scrappers to go out and find domains actively, and update this list weekly/monthly/etc. For now... this is designed to work well with Pi-Hole, just add an adlist and use the raw git url for th eblack list. Maybe in the future we will break teh blacklist down into a few smaller ones for easy of use. One BIG file isn't exactly ideal once it gets big enough. We work on this in our free time and for free. We just want to save families.
