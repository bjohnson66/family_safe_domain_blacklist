# Disclaimer

## Usage and Purpose:

This repository provides a list of domains for use with Pi-Hole software for content filtering. It is important to note the following:

1. **Diverse Content:**
   - Not all domains in this list are of explicit or adult nature. The list may include a variety of domains serving different content.

2. **False Positives and Negatives:**
   - This list may have false positives, mistakenly blocking non-explicit content, or false negatives, allowing explicit content. Users should be aware of the potential for inaccuracies.

3. **Non-Representative of Companies:**
   - Inclusion in this list does not imply that the companies or entities owning these domains are associated with explicit or inappropriate content. It is not a representation of their reputation.

4. **Disabling Pi-Hole or Removal Requests:**
   - Users who encounter issues, false positives, or wish to access specific sites can disable Pi-Hole temporarily. Alternatively, they can submit a request to have a site removed in case of a false positive.

5. **Limited Liability:**
   - The maintainer of this repository is not liable for any consequences arising from the use of this list. Users are encouraged to review and understand the implications before implementing it.

## Legal Considerations:

This repository is shared in the spirit of community and open-source collaboration. Users are advised to be aware of and comply with the terms of service of the services they interact with, including but not limited to Pi-Hole, GitHub, and the relevant content providers.



# Readme is a work in progress. 

Will publish a full readme once I get the project working at some kind of scale. Ideally, we get a few web scrappers to go out and find domains actively, and update this list weekly/monthly/etc. For now... this is designed to work well with Pi-Hole, just add an adlist and use the raw git url for th eblack list. Maybe in the future I will break teh blacklist down into a few smaller ones for easy of use. One BIG file isn't exactly ideal once it gets big enough.I work on this in my free time and for free. I just want to save families.
